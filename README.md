# Haar-cascade-based-face-detector
Detection based on Haar cascade is the simplest of methods of detect a human face

It is implemented here

This program is based on the model created by the algorithm proposed on 
      P. Viola and M. Jones, "Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features," Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. CVPR 2001, 2001, pp. I-I, doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2001.990517.

The requirements for this are haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file from  the repo https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades and OpenCV
