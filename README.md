# Haar-cascade-based-face-detector
# As a visitor detection System

Detection based on Haar cascade is the simplest of methods of detect a human face

It used to implement a simple visitor detection system that can be employed at the gate and take a look at the last visitor .

Note: This program does not differentiate between one human and the other.


This program is based on the model created by the algorithm proposed on 
      P. Viola and M. Jones, "Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features," Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. CVPR 2001, 2001, pp. I-I, doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2001.990517.

The requirements for this are haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file from  the repo https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades and OpenCV
